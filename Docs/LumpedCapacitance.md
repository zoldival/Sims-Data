https://etrl.mechanical.illinois.edu/pdf/ME320/Lecture%2012%20-%20Lumped%20Capacitance.pdf

1. $h$ is heat transfer coefficient
1. $k$ is thermal conductivity coefficient
1. $c$ is specific heat capacity
1. $ρ$ is density
1. $Bi$ is [biot number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot_number)
    - This calculation reveals if the lumped capacitance model is valid
    - Different denominator for slab v. cylinder v. sphere

Tire Dimensions:
- $Front Width = 0.1778 m$
- $Read Width = 0.1905 m$
- $Radius = 0.2032 m$
- $Thermal Conductivity of Rubber = 0.23 [W/m*K]$
- Guess at thickness is 0.0127m (1 in)
