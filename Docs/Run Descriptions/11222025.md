### Run Information

    For each associated log, describe what tests were performed or whether they even contain useful information (turning on the car for 10 sec creates a log but isn't necessarily useful).

    Log 1: ~6 or so laps with a couple likely motor controller errors. Foggy cold driving around 10-11am. LV voltage low is a likely culprit for MC errors.
    Log 2: Restarted car after flashing regen firmware. No noteiceable difference in driving after regen according to driver (Daniel). Let LV battery charge a bit, drove it off to test regen and then off the track. Then let LV battery charge more while writing firmware to fix LV reading on dash and look at regen data.
